# tictactoe-reactnative

A simple app that implements the famous tic tac toe game. Just for me, to understand the main concepts of react native.

Use the comment `expo start`to start the Metro Bundler, which is an HTTP server that compiles the JavaScript code of our app using Babel and serves it to the Expo app. It also pops up Expo Dev Tools, a graphical interface for Expo CLI.
